                    Recreating the game Sudoku was the first big coding project I had ever worked on. I collaborated with three other teammates to complete this project.
                    <br><br>
                    Before we even began coding, we had to come up with a plan on how to approach the project. There were two main parts of the project: the game mechanics and the Graphical User Interface (GUI). The game mechanics included generating a random, solvable Sudoku board and programming the win/lose conditions. The GUI included rendering the grid and designs and taking in user input. Breaking down the project into smaller, more managable portions really helped us tackle the project. 
                    <br><br>
                    One of the biggest hurdles we encountered was implementing the GUI. None of us had experience using PyGame or implementing a GUI in general, so there was a big learning curve we had to overcome. Some resources we used were the PyGame documentation and videos about using the library. Though, once we got used to the syntax, it became a lot easier to implement the GUI. Another challenge that we faced was using Git and Github. Since this was a group project, we needed a way to collaborate on the code, which we used Github for. We were all still new to using Git and Github, so there was a learning curve on using the Git commands.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the biggest takeaways I got from working on this project was how game development works. We took an Object-Oriented Programming approach, which made it a lot easier to generate the Sudoku board. It also kept our code very organized, which made it easier to debug. Additionally, I learned how to implement a GUI and how to use Git and Github.
