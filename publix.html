                <p>Working at Publix was my very first job. I never thought that working at a grocery store would make a big impact on how I grew as a person.
                <br><br>
                When I was initially looking for a job in high school, I wanted one that was not too customer service heavy because I was a very reserved person and thought that I would not like constantly having to interact with people. Though, I eneded up applying for a position at Publix anyway and took the opportunity.
                <br><br>
                Looking back at those two years I spent working at Publix, I am very grateful I took the opportunity to work there. The biggest impact it made was improving my soft skills. This job really pushed me out of my comfort zone. I became a better communicator, teamworker, and leader. My interpersonal skills became stronger and I felt more comfortable talking with customers. I often had to work together with my supervisors and co-workers to accomplish tasks, so I enhanced my collaboration skills. I took on responsibilites, adapted to changes, and resolved issues, all of which made me a make me a better leader.
                <br><br>
                There is often a negative connotation with working in customer service, but that was not the case for me. I would attribute my great experience to the wonderful people I got to work with. My supervisors and co-workers were amazing to work with because they pushed me to get better. My managers made me feel appreciated for my work. My team leaders helped me become a better leader myself. My co-workers were always there to support me.
